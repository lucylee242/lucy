					<h3>Problem</h3>
					<p> Although the UX team conducted weekly usability tests with health coaches to test new features, we had little idea of how coaches used the current version of the product. It was difficult to understand remotely how coaches interacted with the suite of products, and how they employed workarounds. A group of product managers and I were selected to visit two coaching centers and to observe coachâ€™s workflows and painpoints. As the sole member from the UX team, I led the effort in organizing the research trip.</p>

					<h3>Process</h3>
					<h6>Preparation</h6>
					<p> First off, since we would be broken up into two sites across two time zones, I knew standardized data-collection would be important. I created a wiki page of best practices when conducting contextual inquiry and when interviewing users, and shared these methods with my team members. I also created interview scripts that we could use when conducting interviews, and shared a common note-taking method that would help streamline the process of analyzing results. </p>
					<h6>Contextual Inquiry</h6>
					<p> Once onsite, we observed the health coaches in their calls with participants, and noted their process from how they prepare for a call (what documents they refer to, what programs they prep on their screen), their process during a call and any difficulties they faced, and their documentation after a call. We then asked follow-up questions and noted any outside tools they used, and also any documentation they kept outside of the software.   </p>
					<h6>Design workshop</h6>
					<p> I also conducted a design workshops with the coaches, where I asked them to create an empathy map of their participants, and then another empathy map of a hypothetical coach persona. I also had them write down the problems they faced with each component of the software (calendar, call scripts), then rate each of the problems to see how severe the group considered the problem. This helped me see what coaches personally thought of as the most severe issues with the software, versus what I had observed. </p>
					<h6>Analysis and recommendations</h6>
					<p> After the trip, I analyzed the data we had collected and created a user persona and scenario, as well as a map of pain points. I also provided a list of recommendations ranked by severity. Although I did propose redesigns to the system, our main conclusion was that development effort needed to be focused on getting the system stable and free of bugs - much of our user feedback revolved around the lack of reliability of system. </p>
					<h6>Redesign and testing</h6>
					<p> Based on our findings, I made some recommendations for redesign efforts on the features that would 1. help reduce the number of steps to complete key tasks, like scheduling a participant or taking notes; 2. that would help reduce the time spent in preparing for a call, by providing a quick summary view. I then conducted usability tests with the redesigns, and presented my findings back to the group. </p>
