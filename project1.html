                        <h2>Problem</h2>
                        <p>At NantHealth, I worked on a cloud-based software program that helps health coaches deliver clinically-approved content to wellness program participants through pre-approved interaction protocols. Although the UX team conducted weekly usability tests with health coaches to test new features, we needed more information on how coaches used the current version of the product. However, because the product team was remote, it was difficult to understand how coaches interacted with the suite of products. Therefore a group of four product managers and I were selected to visit two coaching centers and to observe coachâ€™s workflows and painpoints. As the sole member from the UX team, I led the effort in organizing the research trip.</p>

                        <p>First off, since we would be broken up into two sites across two time zones, I knew standardized data-collection would be important for data analysis. I created a wiki page and held a kick-off meeting to discuss best practices when conducting contextual inquiry and when interviewing users. &nbsp;I also created interview scripts and a common note-taking method that would help streamline the process of analyzing results.</p>

                        <p> Once onsite, we observed the health coaches in their calls with participants, and noted their process from how they prepare for a call (what documents they refer to, what programs they prep on their screen), their process during a call and any difficulties they faced, and their documentation after a call. We then asked follow-up questions and noted any outside tools they used, and also any documentation they kept outside of the software. </p>

                        <h2>Design workshop</h2>
                        <p>In order to understand to better understand the coaches' needs, I conducted a design workshop with the coaches, where I asked them to create an empathy map of their participants, and then another empathy map of a hypothetical coach persona. I chose an empathy map because I wanted to be able to bring back to the team a more contextual and complete picture of our users: what they saw, heard, felt in their work, as well as what they struggled with and what they considered to be 'wins'. The product team also did not have direct access to the wellness program participants, and the coaches were the most knowledgeable and our best bet at getting a more complete picture of participant characteristics.</p>
                        <p>Through the empathy mapping exercise I learned of the competing pressures that coaches felt throughout their day. For example, by protocol they were expected to deliver clinically approved content according to script, but in order to keep participants engaged they often needed to improvise. Also, many of them had chosen to work in the wellness profession out of a sincere desire to help others, so at times it was painful when participants seemed distant or only interested in earning reward points. </p>

                        <p>I also asked the coaches to visually depict their workflows in a journey map, which helped me see what coaches considered to be their major painpoints. Some common sources of anxiety were having to reschedule participants (which often required an extensive amount of maneuvering with the scheduling software) and network connectivity. </p>

                        <p>Lastly, I sent a follow-up survey to coaches to help the team understand coach demographics and also how they rated the severity of the problems we had seen. By triangulating our data methods (observations, in-person workshop, anonymous survey), we could validate our findings and see what coaches personally thought of as the most severe issues with the software, versus what we had observed.</p>

                            <li>Streamline workflow of reviewing status, call execution and documentation needs to made more efficient so that coaches can handle heavier call volumes and participant data is more easily trackable.  </li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Coaches need to quickly access a complete view of a participantâ€™s information before, during and after a call â€“ they currently maintain separate documentation to keep track of participant information.</li>
                                <li>Many coaches are writing notes free text in â€™Additional Notesâ€™, instead of inline within call scripts, leading to potential loss/inefficiencies of trackable data for client companies. Integration between the various applications will help reduce time spent switching between applications or re-entering data. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>The redesign of calendar/scheduling needs to be prioritized: scheduling calls and setting up the calendar takes up a significant portion of coachesâ€™ time and was a common complaint in interviews. 
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Lack of system notifications for important events such as a participant schedule change means that coaches have to keep computers nearby at all times (even on weekends).</li>

                        <p>Based on our findings, I restructured the information architecture of the site, focusing on reducing the coaches' need of outside documentation, and on better supporting larger call volumes by streamlining communication via notes and reducing number of steps in viewing participant information. I then conducted usability tests of redesigns of key problem areas. </p>

                      <h2>Challenges and what I learned</h2>
                      <h3>Getting feedback when many things are going wrong</h3>
                   
<p>At times it was difficult to get feedback from coaches that gave me a clear idea of what kinds of new features or redesigns would be helpful. </p>
<p>For one, the coaches were not using the fullly designed version but a release with incomplete features. Because the coaches were using software that still had many incomplete components, they often had to juggle multiple programs to achieve a task. For example, the current software hadnâ€™t yet implemented a summary of participantâ€™s measurements and steps data, so the coaches would have to open up a different legacy program in order to see this information. Or they had to open up a separate program to make a call to a participant because the click-to-call functionality hadnâ€™t yet been implemented.</p>
<p>
For another, the software routinely had bugs and network problems that reliability was the biggest concern for the coaches, rather than interface or design issues. As company policy, coaches were not allowed to write down any sensitive patient information in any software or paper outside the approved program, yet because of the unreliability of the software (connection problems, bugs), in order to effectively complete their sessions coaches had to keep separate records outside the program. For example, one coach kept a summary of all her participantsâ€™ information in a separate spreadsheet because the system had crashed on her before or during a scheduled session, so that she could still access necessary information.</p>
<p>
Because of these limitations, for the redesigns, I relied heavily on our contexual inquiry observations, since much of the feedback voiced by the coaches was that they would like the software to be bug-free and stable, and wasnâ€™t something that the UX design team could control. We did make sure to point out that this was the highest priority, rather than development effort being devoted to these redesigns. 
</p>
                   <h3>Understanding timing of design recommendations</h3>
                   <p>Because the company had devoted so many resources to this onsite research trip, I assumed that we wanted to come away with significant improvements to coach workflows. However I faced a sigificant barrier in that the development cycles were very behind schedule, and therefore product management was more interested in completing requirements rather in redesigns. Knowing this, when I presented my design recommendations I prefaced it with that they were future-facing, but this got lost in communication and some members of the team  expressed consternation about changes. Also, as a relatively newer member of the team, I found that redesign recommmendations were not taken well at times by those who had extensive ownership of the product.</p>
                   <p>What ended up happening is that enough people remembered some of the recommendations that when future UI problems came up (ex. where do we put that data table), the redesigns were brought up as possible options.</p>
                   <h3>User-centered design in a development environment focused on putting out fires</h3>
                   <p>When I first started working with the team, I was always uneasy with the lack of context we had about our users and their workflows - the design team tended to receive feature requirements from product management and then went ahead to build these features. Therefore I thought that once we had actual user personas and scenarios, we could do more user-centered design, but I found that our design process did not really change after our trip. This is most likely because our established process of building out what we were asked to do had not changed; product management still received feature requests from upper management fairly late in the game, and by the time the design team was asked to design a feature, it was often due yesterday and had to be built to very specific client requirements. We all knew that our design process needed to change, yet there was always a fire to put out, which made change very difficult.</p>
