                        <h2>Problem</h2>
                        <p>The product was a cloud-based software program that helps health coaches deliver clinically-approved content to wellness program participants through pre-approved interaction protocols. Although the UX team conducted weekly usability tests with health coaches to test new features, we needed more information on how coaches used the current version of the product. However, because the product team was remote, it was difficult to understand how coaches interacted with the suite of products. A group of product managers and I were selected to visit two coaching centers and to observe coach’s workflows and painpoints. As the sole member from the UX team, I led the effort in organizing the research trip.</p>

                        <p>First off, since we would be broken up into two sites across two time zones, I knew standardized data-collection would be important for data analysis. I created a wiki page and held a kick-off meeting to discuss best practices when conducting contextual inquiry and when interviewing users. &nbsp;I also created interview scripts and a common note-taking method that would help streamline the process of analyzing results.</p>

                        <p> Once onsite, we observed the health coaches in their calls with participants, and noted their process from how they prepare for a call (what documents they refer to, what programs they prep on their screen), their process during a call and any difficulties they faced, and their documentation after a call. We then asked follow-up questions and noted any outside tools they used, and also any documentation they kept outside of the software. </p>

By triangulating our data methods (observations, in-person workshop, anonymous survey), we could validate our findings and see what coaches personally thought of as the most severe issues with the software, versus what we had observed.</p>

                        <h2>Recommendations</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Getting the system stable and free of workarounds is a high priority: Lack of system reliability means coaches have difficulty trusting the system and have to rely heavily on outside documentation to complete their tasks.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Coaches summarize notes in 'Additional Notes' (whether completing script documentation or not) and copy/paste into spreadsheet or other tool to use during times system is down. </li>
                                    <li>Coaches are hesitant to explore new functionality outside of their learned workflows. </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>                             
                            <li>Streamline workflow of reviewing status, call execution and documentation needs to made more efficient so that coaches can handle heavier call volumes and participant data is more easily trackable.  </li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Coaches need to quickly access a complete view of a participant’s information before, during and after a call – they currently maintain separate documentation to keep track of participant information.</li>
                                <li>Many coaches are writing notes free text in ’Additional Notes’, instead of inline within call scripts, leading to potential loss/inefficiencies of trackable data for client companies. Integration between the various applications will help reduce time spent switching between applications or re-entering data. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>The redesign of calendar/scheduling needs to be prioritized: scheduling calls and setting up the calendar takes up a significant portion of coaches’ time and was a common complaint in interviews. 
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Lack of system notifications for important events such as a participant schedule change means that coaches have to keep computers nearby at all times (even on weekends).</li>
